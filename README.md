# PAIR Interpretability

This repo contains code and articles on [PAIR](https://ai.google/pair) interpretability projects.

### Patchscopes: A Unifying Framework for Inspecting Hidden Representations of Language Models

The [Patchscopes mini-site](https://pair-code.github.io/interpretability/patchscopes) contains a brief introduction to the [longer paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06102), and will have the code uploaded once it is a little cleaner also.


### Visualizing and Measuring the Geometry of BERT
[bert-tree](https://github.com/PAIR-code/interpretability/tree/master/bert-tree) and [context-atlas](https://github.com/PAIR-code/interpretability/tree/master/context-atlas) are repos for two interactive blogposts/visualizations for the paper [Visualizing and Measuring the Geometry of BERT
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02715):

1. [Language, trees, and geometry in neural networks](https://pair-code.github.io/interpretability/bert-tree/) explores the geometry of syntactic information in BERT ([bert-tree](https://github.com/PAIR-code/interpretability/tree/master/bert-tree))

2. [Language, Context, and Geometry in Neural Network](https://pair-code.github.io/interpretability/bert-tree/) explores semantics and context in BERT. See the accompanying tool, [Context Atlas](https://storage.googleapis.com/bert-wsd-vis/demo/index.html?#word=lie), for more details ([context-atlas](https://github.com/PAIR-code/interpretability/tree/master/context-atlas))


### Deep dreaming on text
[text-dream](https://github.com/PAIR-code/interpretability/tree/master/text-dream) contains different experiments and tools to work with deep dreaming
for text.


### LinguisticLens
[data-synth-syntax](https://github.com/PAIR-code/interpretability/tree/master/data-synth-syntax) contains [LinguisticLens](https://storage.googleapis.com/data-synth-trees/demo/index.html), a tool for visualizing generated text data.
